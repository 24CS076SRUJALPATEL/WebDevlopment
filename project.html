      <h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT :-</h3>
      <ul>
      <p>WHAT IS TRAFFIC LIGHT ?​<br>
<li>
A traffic light is a signaling device, usually found at
intersections and pedestrian crossings, that uses red,
yellow, and green lights to regulate the flow of
traffic. The red light indicates that vehicles must stop,
the yellow light means they should prepare to stop, and
the green light allows them to proceed​</p></li>

<p>PURPOSE:-​<br>
<li>

Traffic lights are designed to coordinate the movement
of vehicles and pedestrians, preventing collisions and
promoting smooth traffic flow. ​</p></li>

<p>CONTROL WAYS:-​<br>
<li>
Traffic lights can be controlled manually, by timers, or by
sophisticated computer systems that adjust the timing
of the lights based on traffic volume and other factors. ​

​</p></li>

<p>​<li>
Traffic light can be controlled manually, by timer, or
computer system that adjust the timing of light based on
traffic volume and other factor.​<br>
Here we are going to make traffic control light circuit in
Tinkercad software which can be controlled manually by
selecting input switch A and B.
​</p></li>

<p>COMPONENT USED IN CIRCUIT:-​<br>
<li>
In tinkercad software we are going to use NOT gate, AND
gate and OR gate , Wires, some Resistors, 2 slideswitch, ​
Battery and three LED light Red, Green and Yell
​</p></li>

<p>WORKING OF CIRCUIT:-​<br>
<li>
We design a circuit of traffic light simulator in tinkercad
which can be operated or controlled manually.​

First, select two input slideswitch A and B and Now we
can blink LED manually with the help of gates.​
Second, for Green light which indicates allow to procced
vehicles. At 0 0 input of A and B ,connect input to NOT
gate so output of NOT gate will be 1 and then input NOT
gate’s output to AND gate and output will be 1. so, Green
LED will be blink.​
​
​</p></li>
<li>For Red light which indicates vehicles must stop. At 1 1
input of A and B ,connect input to AND gate and output
will be 1. so, Red LED will be blink.</li>
<li>For Yellow light which means they should prepare to
stop. At 0 1 or 1 0 input of A and B ,connect input 0 to
NOT gate so output of NOT gate will be 1 and connect
input 1 to AND gate and connect output of NOT gate
which is 1 to AND gate so, output will be 1. so, Yellow LED
will be blink.</li>
